        <h3>About this Chart</h3>
        <p>I ran a linear regression on the relative frequencies by chapter
        of each word in <em>The Once and Future King</em>, with the chapter
        number as the independent variable and the relative frequency within
        the chapter as the dependent variable. The upper graph shows the words
        with regressions with the most extreme slopes, representing the
        greatest increase or decrease in the frequency of occurrence of the
        word over the course of the novel. Clicking on a particular word
        displays on the lower graph a breakdown of its relative frequency by
        chapter.</p>
