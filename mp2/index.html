        <h3>About this Chart</h3>
        <p>This chart is a cluster dendrogram, adapted from
        <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339607">this example</a>.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Points</h3>
        <p>You may wonder, "Why is Brazil mentioned in a story set in the
        5th/6th centuries?" It turns out that "Brazil" comes from the phrase
        "Hy Brazil," which is a mythical island west of Ireland.</p>
        <p>How about America? According to Wikipedia, T. H. White's writing
        style made use of anachronisms, of which this is one.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>There he hung or hoved, his vast ironic mouth permanently drawn
            downward in a kind of melancholy, his lean clean-shaven chops
            giving him an American expression, like that of Uncle Sam.</p>
